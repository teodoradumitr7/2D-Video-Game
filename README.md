# 2D-Video-Game
The file presents the levels of the game. I created a 2D game structured on 4 levels, where the main character has to pass 3 stages to reach the end of the journey. Pressing different keys will trigger sound or visual effects. This game is created in Unity and I used C# language, object oriented knowledge and 2D modeling.
